This repository contains 10 labs of robotics solutions. Most of it based on python programming language and also it contains C++. 

Lab 1 is basically the beginning of the use of a simple gopigo robot. It has go. commands to control the robot. 


Lab 2 represents the dot matrix lighting controlling system in a display, use of temperature sensor. 


Lab 3 has Ultrasonic Ranging Module HC to determine the distance and duration. It also includes the use of servo. 


Lab 4 talks about the motion detection, measuring pressure, temperature, altitude by using L3G gyro, LPS ps, LSM303 compass respectively.


Lab 5 introduces the trackbar. Using a camera for differentiating the filtered colours then controlling the gopigo accoroding to the camera selection. 


Lab 6 is all about Dilationation, Erosionation, Imageclosing, bluring the image, morphological operations. 


Lab 7 works with controllers. Here I successfully dveloped and solved the way to get specific line loaction "def get_line_location(frame)" with gopigo using frame function. "def bang_bang(linelocation)": this function was used to implement a simple bang-bang controller. For the implementation of bang-bang controller with hysteresis "def bang_bang_with_hysteresis(linelocation)" was used. Additionally, proportional and PID controller were also introduced in this lab. 


Lab 8 uses a way to get distance from the robot till any obstacle using line sensors. 


Lab 9 premises kalman filter of image processing, image normalisation.


Lab 10 is about the detection of the markers.
