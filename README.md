# README #

This repository contains base files for your work. You can expect to get a few updates from the lecturers as the course progresses.

### Why do we need versioning? ###
* Commit and push all of the code You write regularly. This will have multiple benefits.
** It will act as a backup of Your work in case you accidentally delete something.
** It will act as a backup of Your work in case Your SD-card gets corrupted.
** It will act as a backup of Your work in case You brake any of the functionality that worked well last time.
* It will be used to track Your progress throughout the course.

### What do I need to keep in mind? ###
* You can not commit code straight on to the master branch. You will use student/your-name branch to commit and push all of your code and will create a Pull Request (PR) at the end of each session. (Even if you do not complete the whole lab in one sitting.)
* Keep Your repository tidy.
** Use a uniform naming scheme for files and functions.
** Do not commit large binary files.
* Reuse functions you have already developed. Use them by importing code from previous weeks or by making a copy of the functions.
* **Make sure You reserve a copy of all tasks implementations for the oral examination!**
