# README #

This repository contains 10 labs of robotics solutions. Most of it based on python programming language and also it contains C++. 

Lab 1 is basically the beginning of the use of a simple gopigo robot. It has go. commands to control the robot. 


Lab 2 represents the dot matrix lighting controlling system in a display, use of temperature sensor. 


Lab 3 has Ultrasonic Ranging Module HC to determine the distance and duration. It also includes the use of servo. 


Lab 4 talks about the motion detection, measuring pressure, temperature, altitude by using L3G gyro, LPS ps, LSM303 compass respectively.


Lab 5 introduces the trackbar. Using a camera for differentiating the filtered colours then controlling the gopigo accoroding to the camera selection.
